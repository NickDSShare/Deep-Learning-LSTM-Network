# Deep-Learning-LSTM-Network

Many traditional models require time series to be stationary. However, in modern approach, it is possible to work with data without pre-processing for stationary.

Two methods can be used to handle non-stationary time series data:

### 1) ARIMA (p,d,q) model:

AR(p) Autoregression - An auto regressive (AR(p)) component refers to the use if past values
I(d) Integreation: - differencing of observations for making the series to be stationary
MA(q) Moving Average - describe the error of the model as a combination of previous error terms


### 2) LSTM:

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections.
